## Dna Origami {#dey21_dna_origam}


### Notes {#notes}


#### Typical DNA planar origami size {#typical-dna-planar-origami-size}

A typical planar DNA origami structure contains
approximately 200 staples with unique sequences and
positions, which can serve as uniquely addressable points
in an area of 8,000–10,000 nm 2 (ref. 6 ) .

#### Modifications to DNA structures {#modifications-to-dna-structures}

Second, the functionalization of DNA nanostructures
in most cases necessitates chemically modifying DNA
with molecules of interest. Even with a multitude of
well-​documented DNA-​modification chemistries and a
continuous stream of emerging bioconjugation methods,
finding a robust and controllable conjugation method
for a specific application can be a daunting task. A few
review articles 116 (cite:Madsen\_2019),275 (cite:Stephanopoulos\_2019),276(cite:Yang\_2015) summarize the field’s progress in
this area. Although the most appropriate conjugation
method depends on the application, good candidates
are generally easy to perform in that they require few
steps and use commonly available chemicals, generate
stable products with decent yield, allow stoichiometric
control and retain the structure and function of the
DNA-​modifying moieties. Of equal importance to select-
ing a suitable conjugation chemistry are careful optimi-
zation and rigorous quality control when placing guest
molecules on DNA origami structures. These include
purifying functionalized DNA structures 84 , quantifying
the labelling efficiency and examining/eradicating any
undesired behaviours, such as aggregation or loss of
fluorescence, as a result of DNA attachment.

This study demonstrates that DNA origami
structures can be further assembled into higher
order yet dynamically reconfigurable structures
based on shape complementarity rather than base
pairing, which provides an app
