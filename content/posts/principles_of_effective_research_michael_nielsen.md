Here [Michael Nielsen](../michael_nielsen.md) puts forward his own take on becoming an effective _researcher_. This is broken into two sections. The first opines that the fundamental principles of all effectiveness are a **holistic life, personal responsibility, vision**, and **self-discipline** The second section deals with being an effective _research_. He claims there are two main aspects; **self-development** and the **creative process**.

Self development revolves with building **personal habits that encourage research excellence**. To build these habits MN suggest creating a **feedback loop**; setting small goal to change your behaviour slowly overtime, evaluating your goals and using that to inform how you set subsequent goals.

In developing research strength Nielsen suggests focusing on **developing a unique combination of skills** that gives you a **comparative advantage** over your peers. He also offers a tip for getting to grips, or keeping current with the latest research and that is, **in research go deep not broad**.

The last key component for effective self development in ones research is **creating a high quality reseach environment**. He suggests that an effective strategy of this is improving your environment so that social pressures work for you as a researcher, rather than against you.

The creative process Nielsen says claims is more related to ones individual research style. He breaks research styles down into two categories, **problem-creaters** and **problems-solvers**. Nielson suggests problem-creators develop a good compass for what important and then go exploring faster than anyone else! A good place for these types is in the messes between fields and at the intersection of existing ones.

Nielsen in contrast suggests good problem-solvers be focused, forward moving but adaptable to change. Similarly to problem-creators keeping up to date with a wide variety of fields. This has the benefit of giving problem-solvers new ideas to tackle important problems. Tackling important problems are important as they both progress science considerably and they typically are problem-solvers own personal success metric. Neilsen cautions against only tackling important, difficult problems as one risks Alienating oneself from the research community, Stopping making ongoing contributions to science, losing the habit of success, and losing morale.
