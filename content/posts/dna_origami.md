   " This ignores the finer thermodynamic or mechanical impacts of certain
design motifs, which can additively lead to global faults when summed over the entire
structure. These faults can arise from a number of easily overlooked factors, such as,
for example, a high local density of short hybridized segments between crossovers [84],
or small amounts of torque built up over broad parallel arrays of double-helices. These
can lead to structural instability of the structure stemming from local dominance of the
self-repulsion between neighboring double-helices, or unwanted global deformations, as
shown, for example, in the sheet-like structure shown in Figure 9."
