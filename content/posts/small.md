        -   Many CAD Tools there
        -   Need a way to classify them
            -   We introduce two
            -   By types of structure they support
            -   By user interaction paradigmn
        -   Classification brings a way to group similar tools, but gives little in means of evaluating their fitness for a specific research task.
            -   Due to:
                -   different feature sets between tool even in the same category
                -   individual requirements specfic to each research task
        -   Need a way to evaluate themn
            -   We propose innovative way to evaluate tools that is superior to other methods since:
                -   give a quantitative measure of how well candidiate tools are suited to the task using paired forced decision making
                -   Takes into account individual project and the whole design lifecycle
                -   Is a general method that can be applied to evaluate tools which is independent of specific tools
                    -   Gives it the ability to be generally applied to arbitrary lists of candidate CAD tools
                    -   Contrast to other proposed method that lay out ridgid flowcharts that terminate in a fixed set of tools

        - <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span>  Write Evaluating a CAD Tool subsection     :write:

            When trying to make a DNA structure first need to choose a CAD tool. Choices of a tool can be complex since there are many DNA CAD tools available with different feature sets. Also complicated what the structure is to be used for and the lifecyle of the design (section~\ref{sec:life-cycle}) widly different making a one size fits all recommendation difficult. For example if a  \textcolor{red}{TODO insert helix bundle type} \textcolor{red}{TODO insert shape} wireframe structure is needed to \textcolor{red}{TODO Insert example of wireframe uses and match these to the structure described} \textcolor{red}{TODO insert software} would be a good choice since in provides exactly that. If a large, complex structure built of DNA structures made of many substructures of different types is required a different tool would be required. In this section we introduce a method for classifying DNA CAD tools that can be talored to ones own needs.

            We need a means of evaluating CAD software. Recently <sup id="edded4c96818b540a28e1077626bb6f3"><a href="#dey21_dna_origam" title="Swarup Dey, Chunhai Fan, Kurt Gothelf, , Jiang Li, Chenxiang Lin, Longfei Liu, Na, Liu, Minke Nijenhuis, Barbara Sacc\`a, , Friedrich Simmel, Hao Yan, Pengfei \&amp; Zhan, Dna Origami, {Nature Reviews Methods Primers}, v(1), 13 (2021).">dey21_dna_origam</a></sup> set out a means to classify by generation and set out a flow chart for choosing current generation of CAD tools. It suffers from the fact that,

            -   Classification scheme is imprecise, generational ranking seems almost arbitary and provides no real information
            -   Fig only relates to current DNA design tools, quickly becomes outdated
            -   Considers only the design and not its life-cycle

            Another shorctcomming of  dey does not account for the fact that choosing an appropriate CAD tool is constrained by factors such as ones OS.

            Furthermore the choice of CAD tool puts constraints on, or incurs additional work for what will be done with these designs (during its life-cycle). For example if after designing a structure one needs files for its simulation and visulization, which unless export in the required file format supported by the CAD tool incurs additional work in finding software to convert between file formats. As such the choice CAD tool has a direct impact on the life-cycle of the design and thus designs life-cycle should be considered when evaluating CAD tools.

            This brings the problem evaluating a tool comprehensively. We propose a systematic method for quantitatively evaluating DNA CAD tools that is able to take into account the full life-cycle of the design and can incorporate quantitive and qualitative metrics (or convert qualitative to quantitive metrics).

            First we set out a list of qualifying criteria that a tool is required to have to be considered a candidate. Example are ...
            These are then used to do search for CAD tools that meet these criteria which are stored

            Next a list of desired functionality is set out. This list is used to weight the importance of the desired functionality. Weighting are generated by two-paired forced decisions of functionality.

            Once functionality has been decided and weights have been computed the candidate CAD tools are reviewed and assigned a ranking for each of the required functionality. Importantly rankings are expressed in 25% increments allowing each carry a well defined meaning and require litte congnitve overhead to assign. Next these rankings are multiplyed with the weights and summed giving an overall ranking for the CAD tools. This list can be sorted and the best candidate tools found.

            Flowchart

            -   List Hard Reqs (Qualifiers)
                -   List all types of structs in the design
                -   System contraints: OS, HW, Available software?
                -   What is my budget?
            -   Use Hard reqs to look for software create an inital list (Filters)
            -   Weighted Required Uses (KSF)s:
                -   List them (examples)
                    -   GUI, Script, Top Down

                    -   Sim
                    -   Viz/figs
                    -   Subcomponent
                -   Make tensor product table and compare
                -   (Possibly renormalize and) Determine KSF weighting
                -   Review CAD tool offering and assign objective rating for each KSF
                -   Rank all CAD tools

            **Notes**

            -   Does it support my structure type
            -   machine (environment, hw specs)
            -   my use case exactly?
            -   My export requirements (sim strands etc)
            -   What is required to modify it?
            -   Cost

                \textcolor{red}{TODO Rewrite downsides/shortcomings section}
                While there have been many CAD tools developed for the design of DNA nanostructures there are some common shortcomings of both the currently available tools and the approaches that they take towards nanostructures creation.

                DNA nanostructure CAD tools are typically independently developed by research group investigating different classes of DNA structures they typically do no support the mixing of arbitrary types of DNA structures. Since design, assembly and analysis of these classes of structures is now a well understood problem DNA nanotechnology has begun to move in the direction of integrating multiple types of DNA structures as components in larger, possibly dynamic, designs. The ability incorporate many types of DNA structure in a design, and to use existing designs as sub-components in the hierarchical building of larger structures is a feature that has only recently appeared in DNA CAD software. The only current software, other than \lstinline{small} that supports this is Adenita and MagicDNA.

                In addition to being able to mix different types of DNA structures in designs practical applications will require modeling of DNA together other chemical entities. Both the ability to geometrically model the placement of DNA nanostructures and other chemical entities and the ability to model how the presence of other chemical entities effects the properties of DNA, and vice versa, is required. Currently only Adenita supports incorporation of other chemical entities into DNA nanostructure designs, and its functionality is limited to only rendering and placing them in the GUI.

                The field of simulating DNA structures has also been rapidly advancing, with many simulation tools being released \textcolor{red}{TODO REF and phrasing}. Conventionally use of these tools requires exporting the DNA nanostructure to the file format that is used by the simulation tools. Often CAD tools do not provide this functionality and either a third party tool for the inter-conversion between file formats is needed, such as tacoxDNA~\citep{suma2019tacoxdna}, or if no such tool is available the user needs to implement a file conversion tool themselves.

                If DNA CAD tools allowed an easy means to extend their functionality support for multiple types of DNA structures, combining DNA nanostructures with other chemical entities and adding support for exporting designs to other file types could be easily integrated. Unfortunately no such ability exists for current DNA nanostructures CAD tools. Reasons for this are that current DNA CAD tools have been designed to be good at designing well known classes of structures and as such provide a model and means to describe structures in these classes but lack a model for defining arbitrary chemical entities (both types DNA structures and other chemical entities) and defining interactions between these entities. Even though many DNA nanostructure CAD are implemented as open source libraries and in theory changes could be made to them the lack of a model for such extensions means extensions are added in an \emph{ad-hoc} manner and make incorporation of multiple extensions difficult. Adding to the difficulty of extending DNA CAD tools is that even though many of them are available as open source software they may require environments that are not, for example Adenita is an open source plugin to the commercial SAMSON molecular visualization software and MagicDNA is implemented in Matlab, adding a barrier their extension.

                % The most popular of the 2D GUI based tools is caDNAno~\citealp{douglas2009rapid} which supports 2D origami designs and square and honeycomb DNA origami lattices. While 2D based tools have low computational requirements creating large designs using them quickly becomes unmanageable due to a situation known as \emph{crossover cobweb}. Crossover cobweb occurs when spatially close helices are not nearby in the GUIs 2D projection and crossover staples between these helices lead to an incredibly polluted design space. \textcolor{red}{(TODO maybe fig?)}}

                % \textcolor{red}{TODO Move 3D drawbacks in GUI tools section to Design->drawbacks section
                % The drawback to 3D tools are that more computational resources, especially dedicate graphics processing units (GPUs), are required to design medium to large DNA structures. Another disadvantage of many 3D tools is the time consuming process of manually creating hundreds of staple strands for ones design. \textcolor{yesgreen}{although the recent 3D tools ATHENA~\citep{jun2020rapid} and Adenita~\citep{de2020adenita} allow for the automatic creation of staple strands for some types of wireframe structures. While many 3D design tools are specific to a single class of structure Adenita supports tile, lattice and wireframe structures. Additionally Adenita allows the mixing of DNA nanostructures and other biomolecules, which apart from \lstinline{small}, is the only DNA CAD tool to do so.} Another shortfall of most GUI tools in they do not allow the placement of structures at specified coordinates and that the model defining DNA (for example nucleotide spacing, number of nucleotides per helical turn, helix diameters etc) cannot be adjusted \textcolor{red}{, which is useful modeling conditions where nucleotides are under strain~\citep{dietz2009folding}.

                % \textcolor{red}{TODO Decide if I want to move scripting tools downsides and advantages towards design->downsides or design->choices
                % Scripting based tools are generally more complicated to get started using as they require programming expertise as well as learning the programming model nad the library that implements its API. The advantage of scripting based tools is that once one familiar with them designs can be rapidly created and iterated on as changes require only change in code as opposed to modifying structures in a GUI. Additionally scripting tools require considerably less computational resources to run when compared with gui based tools \textcolor{red}{Scripting tools allow reuse of components by allowing code defining previously designs to used as sub-components in larger designs (of the available GUI based tools only Adenita supports this)}.<br />
                % Furthermore scripting based tools offer three unique advantages over GUI based tools. First since modifications to structures are defined via changes to code as opposed to manual manipulation they can be used for the algorithmic optimization of nanostructures. Secondly, and dependent on the programming model that the scripting tool uses, parameters of the DNA model (e.g. number of base pairs per helical turn) can be specified for different substructures in the nanostructure and structures may be placed precisely in 3 dimensions. Lastly scripting tools can be used in the modeling of DNA nanostructure assemblies where incorporation of components into the resulting nanostructure is stochastic, as for example in~\citep{tikhomirov2017programmable}.

        -   Common uses
            -   Strands sequencs
            -   Sim files
            -   Visualisation files
            -   Perform experiments (document experimental protocols for structs?)

        Points to cover;

        -   Section 2 gave rules for evaluating a tool
        -   Tool provides constraints on designs that can be made, use it to make a design/get the files needed for your next tasks
        -   Describe Common Next tasks
            -   How theyre normally handled
            -   How theyre handled in small (and anything novel here)
            -   Emphasize smalls repo/package manager

        -  Intro

            **Intro:**

            -   Section 2 introduced a framework for evaluating CAD tool to choose for a project
            -   In the evaluation of a cad tool the life-cycle of the design is used to drive decisions on desired functionality.
            -   Here we explore the concept in more depth, introduce some common life-cycle tasks, give the common approaches to them, and detials smalls specific approach. Of particular importance is the introduction of a novel package manager for DNA nanostructures, allowing easy storing and sharing of both design and files related to the designs life-cycle.
            -   Design Life-Cycle
                -   Encompasses tasks relating to the design from the CAD tool but are not necessarily managed by the CAD tool itself.
                -   A clear distinction between these lessens requirements on a specific CAD tool (i.e needs to be able to produce figures for my publication), by shifting it to its own task  (i.e produce figures for publication from designed structure)
                    -   This lessens the requirements on the CAD tool
                    -   Allows making use of more community developments
                    -   Allows more freedom in choice of a pipeline
                    -   E.g Choose a CAD tool that is best suited to desiging the structure at hand even if it does not produce figures, find visualisation software that meets your visualisation requirements, export the design from the CAD tool and open it in the visualisation software, possibly using an intermediate program to convert between file formats

            -   While each reseach project will have its own requirements, leading to different life-cycles
            -   for different designs, there are some common things required.
                -   Here we detail them
                -   and describe smalls approach to them
            -   Not

        -  Visualizaton

            **Visualisation:**

            -   Vis environment might be provided as in GUI tools, often not pub quality
            -   3rd party tool
                -   Low level e.g oxDNA
                -   High level, e.g chimera
            -   Might also require third party tool to convert
            -   Outputs:
                -   files for vis software
                -   files for vis result

        -  Saving

            **Saving Designs and Associated content**

            -   Needed step is saving design and associated content
            -   Want it to all be in one place, with context and all necessary files, and needed notes
            -   Normally CAD tools provide no help with that.
                -   Saved on file (not available)
                -   Github  (not indexed well or standardized)
                -   Use of a database
            -   small has new unique upload fns that send to cloud
                -   lisp files and other files (sim, viz, readme, assembly protocols etc)
                -   Any files can be added and grouped, :keyword, flexible to accomidate anything while still providing logical grouping and organization
                -   Unique ID associated with it, available at website.
                -   code snippet and fig

        -  Sharing

            **Sharing Designs**

            -   Current depending on how it was saved (sec:lc-save)
                -   email, github/repo link, db id one exists
                -   Sup Info (Only at the end, might be in strange formats)
            -   small
                -   Sharing of ID (web based or programatic)
                -   Programmatic mean it will down load the files and description for you, you can even load them if they are small designs
                    -   Lisp allows easy loading of code correctly and getting started quickly
                -   Access to repo of uploaded content that can be searched and downloaded (web or programatic
                    -   allows one to use others code as a starting point to build complex designs, speeding up research in the field and more reproducable science
                -   Up,Down, Search, Install is all functions of package manager.
                    -   Small implements DB for DNA nanotech and also a package manager for downloading and using designs and extensions from the DB
                    -   True power of small shines as it extensions to small can be written and small can be used to upload them to a repository, which can queried, sw packages downloaded, and imported for use all from within small. speeding up the pace and making research more reproducable.
                -   code example (search, read readme, load)

            -   Showed how it can be used to model DNA as a concrete example
            -   Showed how it can be used to interface with otehr libraries (tacox)
            -   Has these planned future contributions
        -   Introduced a means for thinking about and managing the life-cycle of ones designs
            -   "CAD tool choice effects possible choicse of future tasks but after their use they are uninvolved, they should support the possible future tasks that should be able to be performed as well and thats why we have made a package manager"
            -   Introduced package manager that helps manage life-cycle tasks
        -   Has these planned future contributions
        -   How to obtain
