## Note Taking {#note-taking}

:CREATED: <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2021-05-14 Fri 20:13]</span></span>

-   Need an inbox/scratch pad (?Whats the difference)
    -   Reqs:
        -   Quickly capture transient notes and thoughts
        -   Location to keep these notes isolated from [Evergreen Notes](Evergreen/evergreen_notes.md)
        -   A mechanism to drain this transient note Inbox (needs to allow simple intergration and movement of stuff). Close open loops


### [Andy Matuschak](People/andy_matuschak.md)s taxonomy of note types {#andy-matuschak--people-andy-matuschak-dot-md--s-taxonomy-of-note-types}

-   Daily working log
    -   Ephemeral scratchings
-   Writing inbox
    -   Prompts and incomplete notes in a
-   Evergeen Notes
    -   Stubs via  backlinks
    -   Own definitions/terms of art
    -   precise, narrow declarative notes
        -   sometimes these are framed as questions, when evidence is too inconclusive to frame sharply
    -   Higher level API
        -   Abstract over many other notes
        -   Own definitions/terms of art
-   Outline note
-   Proper Noun Notes
    -   Lit Notes (“outline notes,” except for someone else’s ideas)
    -   People
    -   Business
-   Log Notes
    -   They’re akin to a Daily working log, but sliced by some topic of interest rather than by date.

Tactically speaking, I usually denote a note’s “type” with a tag.
