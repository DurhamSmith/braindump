Thinking about:

How can we design new mediums and learning experiences to be more engaging?
    Creating a Î” Model of engagement to think about what makes existing mediums actively engaging versus passively immersive.
	Engaging mediums encourage thought
	Immersive mediums replace thought
    Thinking about Self-learning podcast and how Teaching a topic deepens your own knowledge that topic
    I want to create a Learn with me page on my website
When designing interaction, Design verbs not objects
How can we design better tools for thought?
    Applications are designed for authoring not thinking
